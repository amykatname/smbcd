# Super Mario Bros. CD PC Port - LÖVE 0.11.x

This is a port to LÖVE version 11. Mostly to easily be able to play on iOS. However, as Mari0 AE's update to this version is not complete (what this branch is built off of), some things are not working as intended..on iOS that is, I'm not sure if it's purely the iOS version's fault but oh well! Point is, LÖVE v10 does the job just fine, and this LÖVE 11 version is mostly for people that want to play on iOS, for example
